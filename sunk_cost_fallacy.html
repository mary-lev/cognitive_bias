                        <h1>Sunk Cost Fallacy</h1>
                        <p>In economics and business decision-making, a sunk cost (also known as retrospective cost) is a cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered. Sunk costs are contrasted with prospective costs, which are future costs that may be avoided if action is taken. In other words, a sunk cost is a sum paid in the past that is no longer relevant to decisions about the future. Even though economists argue that sunk costs are no longer relevant to future rational decision-making, people in everyday life often take previous expenditures in situations, such as repairing a car or house, into their future decisions regarding those properties.</p>

                    <h2>Examples of usage</h2>
                   
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Business Investments</strong>:Continuing to invest in a failing project because significant resources have already been spent, even though halting the project would reduce future losses.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Education and Careers</strong>: Completing a degree or staying in a career path solely because of the time and money already invested, despite a lack of interest or better opportunities elsewhere.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Relationships</strong>: Staying in unsatisfying or harmful relationships due to the time and emotional investment made, rather than evaluating the current value or potential future happiness.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Gaming and Gambling</strong>: Continuing to gamble or play a game after repeated losses, driven by the belief that further investment can recover the initial losses.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Healthcare</strong>: Persisting with a treatment or medication regimen that isn't working because of the investment in time and hope for improvement, instead of considering alternative treatments.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Consumer Behavior</strong>: Keeping subscriptions or memberships active because of the initial sign-up cost or fees paid, even when the service is rarely or never used.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Technology Projects</strong>: Continuing with a technology or software development project that is clearly outdated or outmatched by newer technologies, because of the initial development cost and effort.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Real Estate</strong>: Holding onto property that is declining in value or not generating expected returns, due to the initial purchase price and improvement costs, rather than cutting losses.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Each of these examples reflects the fallacy's impact on decision-making, where past investments (time, money, effort) unduly influence current choices, leading to potentially suboptimal outcomes.</p>

                    <h2>Flexible conversation</h2>
                    <p><b>Ludi:</b>So we have an Agent that can make Rational Decision or Biased Decision. In the case when he makes Biased Decision about the Thing (Project, Action, Investment) he takes into account the Past investment in this project (time, money, energy) instead of rational estimation of the current situation or future perspectives?</p>
                    <p><b>ChatGPT:</b>Yes, that's correct. When the agent makes a biased decision, particularly under the influence of the sunk cost fallacy, the decision is disproportionately weighted by the past investments (such as time, money, and energy) made into the project, action, or investment. This happens instead of making a decision based on a rational estimation of the current situation or the future prospects. The fallacy leads the agent to continue investing in the endeavor, often resulting in suboptimal decision-making, because the focus is on recouping sunk costs rather than evaluating the potential for future returns or losses.</p>
                    <p><b>Ludi:</b>Can we describe investment types here?</p>
                    <p><b>ChatGPT:</b>To elaborate on investment types within this context, let's refine the Investment class to include specific types of investments that an agent can make in a project. These types highlight the varied resources an agent might commit, reflecting both tangible and intangible investments.</p>
                    <p><b>Ludi:</b>How we can describe BiasedDecision that takes into account previous investments instaead of estimation of current outcome or future perspectives?</p>
                    <p><b>ChatGPT:</b>To describe a BiasedDecision that prioritizes previous investments over rational estimations of current or future outcomes, we can refine the Decision class specifically for biased decisions. This refinement involves detailing the attributes and relationships that capture the essence of decision-making influenced by sunk costs.</p>

                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <b>Relationships:</b>

                        <li><strong>Project</strong>: A decision is made regarding a project.</li>
                        <li><strong>Investment</strong>: A project has one or more investments.</li>

                    <b>Explanation:</b>
                        <p>The Agent class represents the entity making decisions. The DecisionType attribute indicates whether decisions are made rationally or with bias.
                        The Project class represents the object of the decision, which could be any endeavor like a project, action, or investment. It includes both tangible investments (like money) and intangible ones (like time and energy).
                        The Decision class captures each decision made by an agent, specifying whether it's influenced by rational thinking or bias (such as sunk cost fallacy), and what the outcome was.
                        The Investment class records the specific investments made into a project, including the type and amount.</p>
