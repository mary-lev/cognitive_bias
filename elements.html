					<p>Our project aimed to formalize human cognitive biases using ontology modeling techniques. We
						developed an ontology that captures various aspects of cognitive biases, decision-making
						processes, and their implications across different domains.
						We leveraged existing frameworks and vocabularies to ensure interoperability and alignment with
						established standards. Our approach combined top-down and bottom-up strategies, allowing us to
						refine the ontology based on feedback, insights, and real-world validation.</p>

							<p>By leveraging existing frameworks and vocabularies, such as the Decision Ontology and
								ontologies from the Dublin Core, FOAF, and Schema.org, we ensured interoperability and
								alignment with established standards. In addition, our iterative approach, combining
								top-down and bottom-up strategies, allowed us to iteratively refine the ontology based
								on feedback, insight, and real-world validation.

							<p>Through dialogue with ChatGPT-4, we have enriched our ontology with real-world examples
								and insights, ensuring that it reflects the complexity and nuance of human
								decision-making processes. While our project may only scratch the surface of the wide
								landscape of cognitive biases, it serves as a starting point for further research and
								development in this fascinating area.</p>

					<h2>Do we rely too much on ChatGPT？</h2>
					<p>Instead of using commonly recognized ontology editors like Protégé, we directly use GPT-4 to
						convert designed classes, properties, methods and relations from natural language descriptions
						into formal ontologies with the TTL syntax.
					</p>
					<p>
						Do we rely on ChatGPT so much that we even handed over the whole coding process to it? The
						answer is unfortunately yes, this is absolutely not a standard method to design ontologies,
						whether we should embrace it or not is going to be a question open to doubting and debating.
					</p>
					<p>However, the performance of GPT-4 in terms of OWL codings was beyond our expectations, and most
						generated OWL files can pass validation and visualization without further efforts and
						modifications, not to mention that GPT-4 can correct itself under our instructions. This quick
						approach largely increased our productivity, a large amount of errors possibly made by our group
						of OWL newbies were avoided with the help of LLM.

							<h3>Tips and Tricks
							</h3>
							<p>During our conversation with ChatGPT it happens that sometimes it goes too deep into the
								given context and continues generating the content in the same scope. In such cases it
								does not make much sense to try to correct it and sometimes the better solution will be
								to start a new chat with an improved prompt.

							<h3>Is there a way to combine the ontology of our biases into a single ontology?</h3>
							<p>Yes, we could do this, but the result will depend very much on the potential application
								of the ontology. Do we need to describe all possible situations in which the bias may
								affect our decisions? Or do we need to capture the broad categories and relationships
								between different biases? Depending on the specific requirements and scope of the
								application, we can design the combined ontology to accommodate different levels of
								granularity and detail.</p>

					<h2>Is there a way to combine the ontology of our biases into a single ontology?</h2>
					<p>Yes, we could do this, but the result will depend very much on the potential application
						of the ontology. Do we need to describe all possible situations in which the bias may
						affect our decisions? Or do we need to capture the broad categories and relationships
						between different biases? Depending on the specific requirements and scope of the
						application, we can design the combined ontology to accommodate different levels of
						granularity and detail.</p>
					<p>One approach to combining multiple ontologies is to identify commonalities and overlaps between
						them and integrate them into a unified framework. This involves aligning the classes,
						properties, and relationships from each ontology and resolving any conflicts or inconsistencies.
						By mapping the concepts from different ontologies to a common domain model, we can create a more
						comprehensive and cohesive representation of cognitive biases.</p>
					<p>Another approach is to modularize the ontology by using our existing ontologies as separate
						modules or namespaces for each bias or group of related biases. This allows for easier
						management, maintenance, and extension of the ontology while still allowing for interoperability
						and integration with other ontologies.</p>
					<p>Ultimately, the design and structure of the combined ontology should be adapted to the specific
						needs and goals of the intended application to make sure that it is effective in representing
						the complexity of human cognition and decision making.</p>
