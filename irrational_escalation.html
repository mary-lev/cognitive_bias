                        <h1>Irrational Escalation</h1>
                        <p>Escalation of commitment is a human behavior pattern in which an individual or group facing increasingly negative outcomes from a decision, action, or investment nevertheless continue the behavior instead of altering course. The actor maintains behaviors that are irrational, but align with previous decisions and actions.</p>

                        <p>Economists and behavioral scientists use a related term, sunk-cost fallacy, to describe the justification of increased investment of money or effort in a decision, based on the cumulative prior investment ("sunk cost") despite new evidence suggesting that the future cost of continuing the behavior outweighs the expected benefit.</p>
                            
                        <p>In sociology, irrational escalation of commitment or commitment bias describe similar behaviors. The phenomenon and the sentiment underlying them are reflected in such proverbial images as "throwing good money after bad", or "In for a penny, in for a pound", or "It's never the wrong time to make the right decision", or "If you find yourself in a hole, stop digging."</p>

                    <h2>Examples of usage</h2>
                   
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Business Investments</strong>:A company continues to invest in a failing product because it has already spent considerable resources on its development and marketing. Despite market research showing declining demand or negative consumer feedback, the company pushes additional funds into improving and marketing the product.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Personal Relationships</strong>: In a deteriorating personal relationship, one or both partners might continue investing time and emotional energy, hoping to return the relationship to better times, despite ongoing distress and clear signs of incompatibility.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Military Engagements</strong>: Historical military campaigns often show signs of irrational escalation, where leaders continue to commit troops and resources to conflicts despite strategic disadvantages and mounting casualties, driven by the desire not to lose face or admit defeat.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Government Projects</strong>: Public sector projects, like infrastructure or IT system upgrades, can exhibit irrational escalation when governments continue to allocate budget overruns and additional resources to projects with flawed execution or planning, driven by political pressures and the initial public promise of success.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Gambling</strong>:  A gambler continues to place bets in an attempt to recover losses, believing that the next bet will bring the big win needed to break even, despite ongoing losses and the statistical improbability of recovering past deficits.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These use cases illustrate how irrational escalation can manifest in various scenarios, impacting decision-making and leading to potentially significant negative outcomes. This understanding can be helpful in designing interventions or strategies to mitigate such bias, including better initial planning, setting predefined stopping criteria, and encouraging more objective evaluation processes.</p>

                    <h2>Flexible conversation</h2>
                    <p><b>Ludi:</b>So if I want to model this bias in general circumstances, can I propose that there is an Agent who needs to make a Decision facing the current Situation, which indicates Failure or Loss could happen. The Agent, instead of making Rational Decision and stop the previous wrong decision, is then affected by Cognitive bias and only considers about Previous Investment and wants to Justify it, which leads the Biased decision to continue the previous wrong decision.</p>
                    <p><b>ChatGPT:</b>Yes, your proposed model effectively captures the essence of irrational escalation within a structured framework. Let's refine it into a more formal ontology for clarity and use in various applications</p>
                    <p><b>Ludi:</b>There are new classes and relationships I would like to add: 1. Situation indicated PossibleFailure; 2. Biased Decision decides to continue Previous Investment; 3. Biased decision and Rational decision are both subclasses of Decision; 4. Previous Investment contains attributes of  different types of  investments; 5. Rational Decision contains attributes of different elements that should be considered about.</p>

                    <b>Entities:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Agent</strong>: The decision-maker(s) who are subject to the cognitive bias.
                        <li><strong>Decision</strong>: The specific commitment or course of action taken by the Agent.
                            <ul>
                            <li><strong>Biased Decision</strong>: A decision influenced by cognitive biases, leading to continuation despite failure risks.
                            <li><strong>Rational Decision</strong>: A decision that logically addresses the Situation's demands based on an objective assessment.
                                <ul>
                                <li> Contains attributes like <strong>Risk Assessment</strong>, <strong>Cost-Benefit Analysis</strong>, <strong>Exit Strategy</strong>, which should be considered in making this decision.
                                </ul>
                            </ul>
                        <li><strong>Situation</strong>: The context or environment in which the Decision is made, highlighting the potential or actual Failure or Loss.

                            <li><strong>PossibleFailure</strong>: A specific attribute of the Situation indicating the risk or impending signs of failure.
                            </ul>
                        <li><strong>Previous Investment</strong>: The resources (time, money, effort, etc.) already expended by the Agent on the current course of action.
                            <ul>
                            <li>Attributes such as <strong>Financial Investment</strong>, <strong>Time Invested</strong>, <strong>Emotional Investment</strong>, which detail the types of resources expended.
                            </ul>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Faces (Agent, Situation)</strong>: Describes the Agent being in a Situation where a Decision needs to be made.</li>
                        <li><strong>Makes (Agent, Decision)</strong>: Captures the action of the Agent deciding.</li>
                        <li><strong>Influenced by (Decision, Previous Investment)</strong>: Shows that the Decision is affected by the sunk costs or Previous Investment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Leads to (Cognitive Bias, Biased Decision)</strong>: Indicates that the Cognitive Bias results in making a Biased Decision.</li>
                        <li><strong>Contrasts with (Rational Decision, Biased Decision)</strong>: Highlights the divergence between what is logically advisable (Rational Decision) and what is actually done (Biased Decision) due to the bias.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <b>Processes:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Assessment of Situation</strong>: The Agent evaluates the current Situation, recognizing signs of potential Failure or Loss.</li>
                        <li><strong>Consideration of Previous Investment</strong>: The Agent considers the Previous Investment, which disproportionately impacts the decision-making process.</li>
                        <li><strong>Decision-Making Under Bias</strong>: Influenced by the desire to justify Previous Investment, the Agent disregards rational analyses and opts for a Biased Decision.</li>
                        <li><strong>Outcome of Biased Decision</strong>: The continuation of the ineffective or failing strategy, typically leading to increased losses or failure.</li>
                    </ul>
